## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm properly learning the use of the media query for making sites responsive. I have trouble grapsing the difference between the max-width and the min-width when using it with media query.


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I plan on learning more about media queries, I think they're crucial for making sites responive. I also would look into writing less code but achieving more, I hope to reduce redundant code to the minimum.
